✅ Intelligent Travel Resolution Script

INTELLIGENT TRAVEL RESOLUTION S…

Opening Statement

“Hi, this is [Your Name] from Merchant Services at Intelligent Travels. This call is recorded for compliance and consumer protection purposes.

The reason for my call is regarding a pre-authorized transaction of $6,495 that has been flagged due to an unfulfilled travel package. I’m the assigned case manager handling the dispute and want to speak with you before this moves forward.”

The provider has marked this as a breach of contract due to non-usage, triggering a financial loss claim. I’m calling to review your case before it escalates into a legal collections matter.”

Building Trust

“I see here that you purchased multiple travel packages but couldn’t use them. Could you share what prevented your travel — financial issues, medical reasons, or personal circumstances?

Many customers don’t realize that non-use doesn’t cancel liability. The provider marked your case as a No-Call, No-Show, activating a penalty clause. My job is to advocate for you and explore fair options.”

Legal Positioning

“Your agreement includes a binding non-refundable clause. The provider is arguing profit loss.
However, under consumer protection laws, unfair penalties can be challenged — especially when circumstances were beyond your control.

Right now, I have temporary override authorization to negotiate a settlement before final review.”

Resolution Offer

“Instead of paying the full $6,495, I can significantly reduce the amount based on your case. I can secure an adjusted balance of $_____ today, but only if resolved during this call.

This prevents:

Collections

Legal action

Further penalties

Would you like me to finalize the resolution?”

Payment & Compliance

“To proceed, the adjusted amount will be $_____. We accept all major cards, PayPal, or check-by-phone.

Before processing, please confirm that the card has sufficient funds.”

Finalizing

“Once processed, you’ll receive four confirmation emails including:

A DocuSign agreement

Transaction confirmation

Legal documentation

A hard copy arrives within 10–14 business days.

This call is fully documented for your protection. Do you have any final questions?”✅ Australian Energy Outbound Campaign
